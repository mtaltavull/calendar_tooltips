SUMMARY

The purpose of the Calendar Tooltips module is displaying
a tooltip / popup / balloon when you hover over a day on
a calendar block. This tooltip would contain a list of events occurring
on that day.

REQUIREMENTS

This module requires the Calendar and Views modules. It also depends on the Qtips2 jQuery plugin for displaying the tooltip. The Qtip2 plugin
has been included with the calendar_tooltips module. At the time of the Drupal 8 development of this module,
the Libraries API module was not ready. In the future, the Libraries API module should be leveraged to include the Qtip2 library.
You can find that jQuery extension on: http://qtip2.com/.

CONFIGURATION

You can change which event fields are displayed in the fields section
of the block view settings of the calendar view. Go to the calendar view and add what fields you would like to be displayed
in the fields section.
